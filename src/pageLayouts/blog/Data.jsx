Though, it&rsquo;s true that ever since its introduction no major change has been witnessed in CD70 except for the stickers.</p><p>Most of us regularly criticizing <a href=\"https://www.ebike.pk/new-bikes/honda\">Atlas</a> for not making any major change in CD70 since 1976 and it is true that no quality improvement have been witnessed. It is now important to understand the reality that Honda CD 70 is the Ist choice of masses in Pakistan mainly due to its fuel efficiency and economical parts. Furthermore, it is also a reality that <a href=\"https://www.ebike.pk/new-bikes/honda/honda-cd-70/225\">CD70</a> users are stick with this brand like a glue and they are not ready to accept any change (shape/design) except for the stickers. Every year they anxiously wait for the new model and ready to pay the premium price for the sticker change, which clearly reflects in the financial results of Atlas Honda Ltd. According to the financial year ended 2021 the AHL has posted a revenue of PKR. 93.0 Bn with a profit of PKR 3.5 Bn. The major chunk of the company&rsquo;s revenue is achieved from their flagship variant CD70, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that this variant has reasonable quality standards. It is also a reality that the CD70 users are not ready to accept the change in shape or design, even cd70 user need electric bike in 70cc shape. As masses in Pakistan are not ready to accept electric bike in scooty shape. Hence the assembler and the importers decided to follow the market demand and introduced Jolta Electric bike and other imported electric bike brands similar to 70cc bike shape.</p><p>Similarly, Atlas Honda introduced a much improved variant called CD70 Dream compared to CD70. However, CD70 users didn&rsquo;t accept this positive change occurred in Dream like Comfortable Seats, Stylish Appearance, Special Fuel Tank Design, Colored Econo Power Engine, 03 Years Engine Warranty, Stylish Speedo Meter and Comfortable Seats.</p><p>We believe some drastic changes in motorcycle quality should be done, considering the users safety and comfort and the price must be reduced in accordance with the motorcycle quality. As far as 101 changes in Cd70 is concerned, it is too early to comment on this. The Cd70 users themselves will tell their experience about this change after own riding experiences. &nbsp;</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Probably the bore would shrink to 73mm, however stroke would increase to 67.5mm. This would help to get more torque at the low end, which would help the power boost from turbo. The turbo will increase peak power to 180hp at 8,500 rpm, which mean plenty of torque required on low end. Furthermore, the bike would probably make 176.17 Nm of torque (roughly 130 lb-ft of torque)</p><p>Yamaha&rsquo;s upcoming turbo bike would also have variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust as well as direct fuel injection.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

Yamaha&rsquo;s Niken is powered with 03 cylinder 847cc engine from their own MT09 model.</p><p>The Patent images of Aprilia&rsquo;s trike clearly shows that the rear end of this trike will be Aprilia Mana, a most suitable choice due to its 839cc, SOHC V twin engine. The performance, stability and two front wheels of this new machine would be potential choice for the new riders. &nbsp;</p><p>Aprilia&rsquo;s patent emphasized on high quality front suspension system. Both MP3 and Niken tilting front end on this patent is based on a set of parallel spars, which mount on pivots that is below bars. It also carry head tube at each end, allowing front wheels lean at same angle as main body of bike. Whereas MP3 features leading link suspension and Niken uses telescopic forks. The Aprilia&rsquo;s new trike design curved alloy uprights leading down between the front wheels, connecting to them via four short, wishbone-style links.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

So far the motorcycle riders in Pakistan have a limited reliable options in 150cc segment for touring. Similarly the OEM&rsquo;s are still unable to understand the real demand of bike tourers.

The strong and powerful shock absorbers with an excellent metallurgy is the hall mark of this touring bike. However, the appearance of this motorcycle should be upgraded. Furthermore, the expert or certified Suzuki mechanic is required to look after mechanical and electrical issues of this bike, still it is the number choice for bike touring riders.</p><p>Yamaha YBR 125 another choice for the tourers available in 125cc range, the motorcycle is equipped with&nbsp;single cylinder 04 stroke air cooled SOHC engine with 05 speed transmission. YBR 125&rsquo;s 13 ltr fuel tank, allows its rider to continue their riding with minimum fuel fill-up delays even on long journeys.

Similarly the rider has to stretch his legs to reach the pegs, which are way ahead. The mirrors installed under bar are more appealing and adding the beauty of this bike. The 7.9 ltrs fuel tank with no Fuel Guage (just low fuel warning) will add miseries to the rider during long trips riders.</p><p>Speedometer in Harley 48 is relatively small and round, integrated with tachometer and gear indicator. The stylish indicators are smartly installed at the each side of handle bars. Harley Davidson started assembling Forty Eight in their Indian Plant since 2016 situated at Gurgaon.</p><p>Harley Davidson introduced new suspension with 49mm forks and 130/90B16 front tyre. The front tyre gives 48 a vintage style bike. The Forty Eight is suitable for small riders due to its unique design and appearance. The company has mainly focused on aesthetics and styling as compare to riders comfort. Therefore, the Forty Eight is not a rider friendly bike due to its design but we can that it&rsquo;s a beginner&rsquo;s bike in Harley&rsquo;s Community.</p><p>The complete range of <a href=\"https://www.ebike.pk/used-bikes/bike-by-brand/harley_davidson/35\">Harley Davidson Used Bikes </a>available for Sale in Pakistan.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

        "bloghtml": "<p>The primary objective of <a href=\"https://www.ebike.pk/new-bikes/harley_davidson/harley-davidson-iron-883/155\">Motorcycle</a> Helmet is to protect the motorcycle riders head during accidents. According to research conducted by organizations, a motorcycle rider are at high risk during road accidents and according to them the standard motorcycle helmets reduce the risk of head injury by 69% and death by around 42%.</p><p><strong>History of Standard Helmets</strong></p><p>The trend of motorcycle helmet started in 1935 with a death of T.E Lawrence over handle bars. He was treated by Sir Hugh Cairns - a Neurosurgeon by profession, who initiated the study &ldquo;An Effect of Head Trauma during Motorcycle Crash&rdquo;. Though his efforts helped to create a first Cairn Crash Helmet but the helmet was designed in such a way, which only can protect the rider from penetration injuries.</p><p>Later Herman Roth, introduced helmet having energy absorbing liner with an inner layer made of substantially non resilient material, hard outer shell, floating inner system and chin strap. A renowned car race driver Pete Snell was died in accident, wearing the Roth standard helmet. The group of family and friends of Snell established Snell foundation in 1957 with an objective to create effective helmet standard, which can minimize the risk of death in case of head injuries.</p><p><strong>Importance Motorcycle Helmet Safety Standards</strong></p><p>There are various motorcycle helmet safety standards effective throughout the world. Some of the known motorcycle standards</p><p>U.S.A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- DOT</p><p>Brazil &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- NBR 7471</p><p>Malaysia &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- SIRIM</p><p>Singapore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;- PSB</p><p>Japan &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- SG - JIS</p><p>India &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - IS 4151</p><p>Thailand &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - TIS</p><p>Australia &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-AS 1698-2006</p><p>Korea &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -KS G 7001</p><p>New Zealand &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - NZ 5430</p><p><strong>DOT:</strong></p><p>The word DOT stands for U.S Department of Transportation. The <a href=\"https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/pedbimot/motorcycle/unsafehelmetid/pages/page2.htm\">DOT</a> standard adopted federal standard FMVSS 218.</p><p><strong>ECE:</strong></p><p>ECE stands for Economic Commission for Europe and the standard has been followed in 50 European countries. Any helmet having ECE 22.05 means the helmet is exposed to number of tests, which determine that helmet is offering sufficient protection on European roads.</p><p><strong>SNELL:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell_Memorial_Foundation\">Snell</a> standards determine by Snell Memorial Foundation. It has the most effective helmet testing.</p><p><strong>Standard Motorcycle Helmet Design</strong></p><p>Most of the standard approved motorcycle helmets design with the following principles</p><ul><li>Outer Shell</li><li>Crushable Layer</li><li>Padded Comfort Layer</li><li>Chin Strap</li></ul><p><strong>Outer Shell</strong></p><p>The outer shell of a helmet is designed with very hard material, so it can protect the rider head from hitting the ground. The material in the outer shell is made of hard plastics, Kevlar, carbon fiber or fiberglass materials. The objective is to protect from the hard ground, tearing a big hole in rider&rsquo;s head.</p><p><strong>Crushable Layer</strong></p><p>The thick foam layer is attached with outer shell that fits with it. The material used in this layer is made up of EPS (expanded polystyrene). The material use in this layer is very light and crush the under pressure. Hence it is called crushable layer.</p><p><strong>Padded Comfort Layer</strong></p><p>As the name clearly suggest that this layer has been designed for comfort and it is attached with cushioned interior, which makes the motorcycle helmet comfortable. The padding layer is design in such a way so it can protect the helmet edges during crash.</p><p><strong>Chin Strap</strong></p><p>The chin strap of motorcycle helmet is secured the riders chin to keep the helmet on riders head during ride. It is made up of woven material and fastened with 02 D rings.</p><p><strong>Life of Standard Motorcycle Helmet</strong></p><p>According to Snell Memorial Foundation, the standard approved helmet degradation occurs due to hair oil, body fluids, cosmetics, fuel, paints and other material. The degradation directly affects helmet performance. Hence, it is mandatory for every rider to replace the helmet after 05 years.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",

        "blogTitle": "Future of Electric Bikes in Pakistan",
        "bloghtml": "<p>In modern time and age, it is a necessity to update and progress. With the progress in every field, there have been numerous impressive updates in the field of automotive vehicles. In that long list comes bikes, with their latest euro 5 technology another groundbreaking technology is the electric bike or ebike.</p><p>Ebike uses motor instead of an engine and to power that motor it uses electricity. This is advantageous for a number of reasons like air noise pollution instead of the engine running electric bikes uses motors which are smooth and softer, environment-friendly in the sense that producing and consuming electricity is far more eco-friendly then production &amp; consumption of oil and gas in which we literally deplete the earth inside and out.</p><p>Pro-Ebike uses the environmental factor to justify and promote the use of electric bikes and motorcycles, and maybe they should. However, when it comes to practicality and the use of bikes, we have to consider their functionality and use. In countries like Pakistan, people use <a href=\"https://www.ebike.pk/used-bikes\">bikes</a> for their everyday commute, some even rely on their bikes for their living and given the conditions of our infrastructure these bikes have to be very robust. Electric motorcycles may sound very ideal however we have to consider their strengths and weakness to critically analyses them.</p><p>One company has started manufacturing e-bikes locally and claims to have tailored it to the demands and needs of Pakistani society. They came up with different models that needed to be charged from 5 hrs. to 8 hrs. to give an estimated mileage of 50-kms to 120-km (per charge) and a top speed of 80-km/h (depending on the model). The stats sound promising however does this suit the needs of our local population?</p><p>But are these bikes really true to their claim? Knowing that a major source of electricity is thermal i.e., from oil and coal the claim to be environment-friendly goes to waste. We are merely shifting the pollution from our cities to industrial sites. Also considering the life of battery and motor in these bikes. Since these batteries aren&rsquo;t locally manufactured it&rsquo;s hectic to risk buying them and rely on them. Another major problem is the resale of these bikes given that these motors and batteries have a very short life it isn&rsquo;t very feasible to buy these bikes also keeping in mind the trend in Pakistan is to trade these bikes after use.</p><p>The major concerns of bike users are if these ebike could bear the rough and tough usage of these bikes if they would be able to overcome the bumps and jumps of our roads. Could these bikes cater to those who depend on bikes for their daily commute? Would there be any support services for these users? Is it more economical and reliable?</p><p>Regardless, it&rsquo;s great to see Pakistan progressing and adopting new trends and technology only if these requirements are met these E-Bikes would revolutionize the traditional ways.

Though the value of money has not been paid to the users and no drastic change has been made in structure or the body of 70cc bikes except for stickers. Some bike assemblers argued that any change in the 70cc motorcycle might not accept by the market. Therefore, the bike assemblers are not ready to make any changes in the 70cc motorcycles.</p><p>The 70cc motorcycle trend had been initiated by Atlas Honda Limited in 1976. Pakistan perhaps the only country in the world with 70cc motorcycle segment both in Japanese and Chinese versions. The major chunk of the motorcycle market share in Pakistan has also been dominated by 70cc Motorcycles followed by 125 and 150cc. The rising demand of 70cc motorcycles has forced Chinese motorcycle assemblers to enter in this segment. In mid 2000 the Chinese bike assemblers provided 70cc motorcycle users another option other than CD 70 at an economical price.</p><p>Some of the leading brands United, Road Prince, Superpower and Ravi started assembling 70cc motorcycle. The engine and body parts of the Chinese motorcycles are more or less have same quality but still the new bike prices varies mainly due to re-sale. The Chinese bike assemblers are charging premium from PKR 5,000/- to PKR 10,000/- in the name of quality and re-sale and the users are ready to pay it. Hence, the trend of 70cc motorcycles has been continued for 04 decades.</p><p data-f-id=\"pbf\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 30px; opacity: 0.65; font-family: sans-serif;\">Powered by <a href=\"https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor?pb=1\" title=\"Froala Editor\">Froala Editor</a></p>",
